if u want to delete the installed package from the node u have two ways --
1. delete that package from the node file and from the package.json then do npm i 
2. npm uninstall package_name



if i have commited the env file or aisi file jo commit nhi honi cahiye uske liye command is ::

here the command git rm -- means that the file is removed from the git tracking and --cached means git se tho remove ho jayegi but local system pe rahegi vaha se delete nhi hogi
git rm --cached config/.env             -- here config bas isliye likha hia kyuki vo ek flder ka name hai and env file ek folder mai hai 
git commit -m "Stop tracking env file"





new package and why to use :

1. to upload file or handeling file -- we use 
    express-fileupload and multer
